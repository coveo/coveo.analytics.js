# Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Guidelines

- Make sure your changes are fully tested (when applicable).
- We tend to avoid comments in our code base, we strongly prefer good naming and code structure.
- Avoid pushing similar changes in different commits if it's within the same feature, because we want the changelogs to be clear and simple. To avoid that, there are at least 2 options:
    1. Squash the commits into one when merging (you need to edit the final commit message though)
    1. Amend the previous commit when making related changes (`git commit --amend --no-edit`)
